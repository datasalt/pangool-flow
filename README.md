pangool-flow
============

Pangool-Flow is an experimental module on top of Pangool (http://pangool.net) which adds automatic flow building and management. Pangool-Flow adds a higher-level layer on top of Pangool by imp lementing "Ops" so that the most common operations can be implemented much quicker, while retaining all of Pangool's flexibility and low-levelness (it is still possible to implement raw Mapper, Reducer and C ombiner instances in any of the Flow's Jobs).
